#Don't wrap lines
set nowrap


## Make the 'nextword' function (Ctrl+Right) stop at word ends
## instead of at beginnings.
#set afterends

## When soft line wrapping is enabled, make it wrap lines at blanks
## (tabs and spaces) instead of always at the edge of the screen.
# set atblanks

## Automatically indent a newly created line to the same number of
## tabs and/or spaces as the preceding line -- or as the next line
## if the preceding line is the beginning of a paragraph.
# set autoindent

## Use bold text instead of reverse video text.
# set boldtext

## Do case-sensitive searches by default.
# set casesensitive

## Constantly display the cursor position in the status bar.  Note that
## this overrides "quickblank".
set constantshow
#const?

## Use cut-from-cursor-to-end-of-line by default.
# set cutfromcursor

## Do not use the line below the title bar, leaving it entirely blank.
# set emptyline

## Scroll the buffer contents per half-screen instead of per line.
# set jumpyscrolling

## Display line numbers to the left of the text.
set linenumbers

## Enable mouse support, if available for your system.  When enabled,
## mouse clicks can be used to place the cursor, set the mark (with a
## double click), and execute shortcuts.  The mouse will work in the X
## Window System, and on the console when gpm is running.
# set mouse

## Switch on multiple file buffers (inserting a file will put it into
## a separate buffer).
set multibuffer

## Don't convert files from DOS/Mac format.
# set noconvert

## Don't display the helpful shortcut lists at the bottom of the screen.
# set nohelp

## Don't automatically add a newline when a file does not end with one.
set nonewlines

## Don't pause between warnings at startup.  Which means that only the
## last one will be readable (when there are multiple ones).
# set nopauses


## Preserve the XON and XOFF keys (^Q and ^S).
# set preserve

## Do quick status-bar blanking.  Status-bar messages will disappear after
## 1 keystroke instead of 26.  Note that "constantshow" overrides this.
set quickblank

## Try to work around a mismatching terminfo terminal description.
# set rawsequences

## Fix Backspace/Delete confusion problem.
# set rebinddelete

## Do regular-expression searches by default.
## Regular expressions are of the extended type (ERE).
# set regexp

## Put the cursor on the highlighted item in the file browser, and show
## the cursor in the help viewer; useful for people who use a braille
## display and people with poor vision.
# set showcursor

## Make the Home key smarter.  When Home is pressed anywhere but at the
## very beginning of non-whitespace characters on a line, the cursor
## will jump to that beginning (either forwards or backwards).  If the
## cursor is already at that position, it will jump to the true
## beginning of the line.
set smarthome

## Use this tab size instead of the default; it must be greater than 0.
set tabsize 4

## Convert typed tabs to spaces.
# set tabstospaces

## Save automatically on exit; don't prompt.
# set tempfile

## The two single-column characters used to display the first characters
## of tabs and spaces.  187 in ISO 8859-1 (0000BB in Unicode) and 183 in
## ISO-8859-1 (0000B7 in Unicode) seem to be good values for these.
## The default when in a UTF-8 locale:
set whitespace "»·"
## The default otherwise:
# set whitespace ">."

## Detect word boundaries differently by treating punctuation
## characters as parts of words.
# set wordbounds

## The characters (besides alphanumeric ones) that should be considered
## as parts of words.  This option does not have a default value.  When
## set, it overrides option 'set wordbounds'.
# set wordchars "<_>."

## Let an unmodified Backspace or Delete erase the marked region (instead
## of a single character, and without affecting the cutbuffer).
#set zap

## Paint the interface elements of nano.  These are examples;
## by default there are no colors, except for errorcolor.
# set titlecolor brightwhite,blue
# set statuscolor brightwhite,green
# set errorcolor brightwhite,red
# set selectedcolor brightwhite,magenta
# set stripecolor ,yellow
# set numbercolor cyan
# set keycolor cyan
# set functioncolor green
## In root's .nanorc you might want to use:
# set titlecolor brightwhite,magenta
# set statuscolor brightwhite,magenta
# set errorcolor brightwhite,red
# set selectedcolor brightwhite,cyan
# set stripecolor ,yellow
# set numbercolor magenta
# set keycolor brightmagenta
# set functioncolor magenta

## Key bindings.
## See nanorc(5) (section REBINDING KEYS) for more details on this.

## The <Ctrl+Delete> keystroke deletes the word to the right of the cursor.
## On some terminals the <Ctrl+Backspace> keystroke produces ^H, which is
## the ASCII character for backspace, so it is bound by default to the
## backspace function.  The <Backspace> key itself produces a different
## keycode, which is hard-bound to the backspace function.  So, if you
## normally use <Backspace> for backspacing and not ^H, you can make
## <Ctrl+Backspace> delete the word to the left of the cursor with:
# bind ^H chopwordleft main

##Bind keys in form: bind key function menu
## where key is in the form ^{<alpha>|Space}, M-{<printable>|Space} or F{1-16}


## If you would like nano to have keybindings that are more "usual",
## such as ^O for Open, ^F for Find, ^H for Help, and ^Q for Quit,
## then uncomment these:
bind ^W exit all
bind F1 help all
bind F1 exit help

unbind ^G all
